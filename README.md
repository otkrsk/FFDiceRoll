FF Dice Roll
============
## Introduction
**Fighting Fantasy Dice Roll** (or **FF Dice Roll**) is an iOS app that simulates dice rolls.

The name was inspired by Ian Livingstone's Fighting Fantasy books, which requires dice to play. The books are a _"Dungeons & Dragons"_ type game in which the reader is a character and has to navigate through the book by choosing which "chapters" he or she would like to go to perform actions.

Though the books only require six-sided dice, I've included a ten-sided and a twenty-sided dice in the app as well.

## Usage
Using the app is fairly straightforward. Once it has finished loading, you will be presented with an option to choose how many dice you want to roll and the type of dice you want to roll (d6, d10 or d20). Once you have chosen your die (or dice), click on the **Let's Roll!** button, or alternatively, you can shake your device to simulate rolling a die (or dice).

## _Postscriptum_
I'm building this off the top of my head, as it was started as a little hobby project for me (and also to get familiar with the Swift programming language), so there will be many features that will be implemented as I come up with with ideas on how to enhance and improve the app.
