FF Dice Roll
============
**Fighting Fantasy Dice Roll** (or **FF Dice Roll**) is an app that simulates dice rolls.

The name was inspired by Ian Jackson's Fighting Fantasy books, which required 2d6 to play. The book is a _"Dungeons & Dragons"_ type game in which the reader is a character and has to navigate through the book by choosing which "chapters" he or she would like to go to perform actions.

I'm building it off the top of my head so there are features that are implemented as I go along.
